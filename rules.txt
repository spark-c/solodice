# E Dice

dice
- 20
- 12
- 10 x2
- 8 
- 6
- 4

object is to get highest possible roll for each of the dice

1. roll all dice until you get a successful roll
2. take die out and roll the rest
3. each die that is successful/removed can be spent to give a +1 to a die in play. add the spent die back to the rolling pool
4. if you can't remove a die on any given round, game over

attempt to put together a points / pvp system where you need to get more points than your opponent. best to finish will all dice, but you should get some amount even if you don't finish

when in multiplayer, should it be real time with an incentive for first to finish, or should time not matter?
